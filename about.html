                    I'm a passionate computer applications student, focusing on building practical solutions through coding and design. My journey in technology began with my studies in BCA, and I continue to explore ways to merge functionality with creativity.

                    With a solid foundation in computer applications, I aim to create intuitive and accessible solutions that address real-world problems. My studies have given me the technical skills to design and develop systems that are both effective and user-friendly.

                    Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in design, ensuring that the applications I build are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. When I’m not immersed in my coursework, you’ll find me exploring new ideas, diving into creative projects, or dancing!
